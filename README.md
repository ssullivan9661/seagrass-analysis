## Introduction

Workflow for the Python-based-pipeline analysis of Sentinel-2 and turbidity data with correlation to coastal seagrass dynamics in Upper Keys, FL. The goal is a reproducible workflow for integrating satellite imagery with environmental data to analyze coastal ecosystem health.

### Spectral Indices

| Name | Abbreviation | 
| --- | --- | 
| NDVI | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index | 
| EVI | Enhanced Vegetation Index | 
| NDWI | Normalized Difference Water Index | 
| NDAVI | Normalized Difference Aquatic Index |
| SSI-II | Submerged Seagrass Index |
| NDTI | Normalized Difference Turbidity Index |
| DII | Depth Invariant Index |

## Structure

This cookbook is initially divided into two sections Sentinel-2 imagery and water quality data processing for notebooks 00-03, and then joined for the main analysis in the final 04-06 notebooks. 

### Sentinel-2 Imagery Data Processing

Python code for automated processing of Sentinel-2 raster data, includes the download, access, preprocessing, and calculation of spectral indices using libraries such as Pandas, Xarray, Rioxarray, and Rasterio, contained in notebooks 00-03. Manifest `.csv` files are saved throughout, which are metadata summaries of processed data, with the goal of memory effeciency. 
- `00_Copernicus_Downloading` - contains instructions for downloading Sentinel-2 data for a range of years, and code for converting shapefile polygon dimensions to preferred JSON format for defining an AOI in the [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) search engine.
- `01_access_data` - contains a working code to unzip, convert file type jp2 -> tif, and save scene by scene as netCDF, and delete from memory to prevent memory or RAM issues on any device. Outputs a manifest records of each scenes `.nc` is also saved as CSV.
- `02_preprocess_imagery` - Clips scenes to the area of interest shapefile and masks cloud cover for L2A scenes to save as `.nc` per scene and manifest record of clipped/masked scenes.
- `03_calculate_indices` - Calculate spectral vegetation indices - NDVI, NDWI, NDAVI, EVI, SSSII, NDTI, and DII - and also incorporates a correction for water column depth calculating DII or the Depth Invariant Index. Outputs a `indice_summary.csv` of calculated indices.

### Water Quality Data Processing

Automated water quality data pipeline to prepare, analyze, and relate parameters to Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for better understanding of seagrass dynamics over the study period 2015-2024, contained in the 04 notebooks.
- `04_water_quality_data_preparation.ipynb` - Queries and cleans water quality data to focus on the parameters of interest; Turbidity, Temperature, Secchi Depth and Chlorophyll-a within the bounding box of the study area, the Upper Keys, Fl. Pivots the raw data into a usable format to then build as GeoDataFrame and outputs a paraquet file of valid historical water quality records.


### Combined Analysis Features

The main analysis workflow integrates and joins the spectral vegetation indices and water quality data, in notebooks `05` - `07`. Using various Python modules and libraries for data statistics, visualization, time-series, and spatial mapping to uncover patterns and trends of seagrass, from sentinel-2 data and water quality data, or measures of ecosystem viability. With automated save and outputs of notable figures in the `figures` folder.

- `05_water_quality` - Main water quality Python based statistical analysis includes both spatial and seasonal distributions of water quality parameters using statistical Python based modules and `matplotlib`. Methods of plotting include correlation matrices, seasonal boxplots, and spatial mean maps.
- `06_time_series_analysis` - Time series analysis and correlation heat mapping of Sentinel-2 data and water quality data ussing the Mann-Kendall test for long term trends of seagrass trends. Incorporates a dual time series and cross correlation heatmap of both water quality data and spectral indices.
- `07_spatial_mapping` - Spatial mapping of spectral indices with water quality parameters to detect patterns and relationships through a predefined basemap and user function using modules `Rasterio` and `Cartopy`. An animation analysis of seagrass dynamics with NDAVI overtime to discover any trend relationships, contained in notebook `07`.  and correlataion heat mapping of NDTI and water turbidity data across Upper Keys, Fl. With automated save and export and notable figures in the `figures` folder.
