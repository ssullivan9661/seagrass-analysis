Workflow for the Python-based-pipeline analysis of Sentinel-2 and turbidity data with correlation to coastal seagrass dynamics in Upper Keys, FL.

# Features
---
- Python code for automated conversion, cloud-masking, and clipping of satiellite raster data files using libraries such as Xarray, Rasterio and Rioxarray.
- Automated water quality data processing with GeoPandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and clipping to the study area using Rasterio, and Rioxarray.
- Calculation of spectral and turbidity indexes using extracted band information of sentinel-2 scenes.
- Spatial mapping of NDVI, NDWI, EVI and Turbidity overlayed with water quality parameters.
- Time series analysis and correlation heat mapping of Sentinel-2 data and water quality data.
- Automated export and save of results.
  
  Ultimately, the goal is a reproducible workflow for integrating satellite imagery with environmental data to analyze coastal ecosystem health.
